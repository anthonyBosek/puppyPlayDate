- `Anthony`: Building this app was great! It incorporated some of the fundamentals of `React` in a new and exciting way. We were able to incorporate client side routing with `React Router` and make this a true SPA. As always, I learned a great deal from the people I worked with on this project. With good communication and shared knowledge, we were able to overcome the conflicts efficiently and complete this project above our expectations. Awesome experience, stellar team!!
